## Building & Running The Project

_(ensure you've cloned/copied this GitHub project first to your local machine)_

 1. Install the latest version of the [Rust development environment](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), if it isn't already installed, via the __rustup__ utility, including the _rustc_ compiler & the _cargo_ package/build manager. _NOTE:_ If building on Windows 10, first ensure you have Microsoft's [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16) installed (and importantly, when running Micosrosoft's _build tools_ installer, choose the _C++ build tools_ option)

 2. From a terminal/prompt/shell, from this project's root folder, run Rust's _cargo_ command to build the project, as shown below:
 
```console
cargo build
```
